# node-red-16x2-lcdpy-writer
Write an output to external 16x2 LCD panel, via SCL SDA, using lcd.py and node-red dashboard http://localhost:1880/ui

This uses the 16x2 LCD Panel from Saisan (i think ?),  uses the SCL SDA LCD converter module for 4 pin wiring. 
Wiring GND PWR SDA SCL to the Raspberry pi board should work.

Made this script executable inside /usr/local/bin
